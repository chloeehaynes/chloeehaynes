## Recent Project
#### [Choosing Classical Guitar Strings](https://chloeehaynes.github.io/ClassicalGuitarStrings/)

For my final research project in my Technical Writing class (Fall 2021), I developed a website that can help users of any skill level choose strings for their classical guitar. Over the semester, I gathered the research, wrote and edited the guide, and developed the code for the final site using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The site can be visited [here](https://chloeehaynes.github.io/ClassicalGuitarStrings/), and the repo can be found [here](https://github.com/chloeehaynes/ClassicalGuitarStrings).
